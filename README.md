# FXSpindle
---
##Definition
**FXSpindle**Â is a library to create ASS (Advanced Substation Alpha) files with karaoke effects.

##Project Paused!
Please refer to [AegiSpindle](https://github.com/Kagurame/AegiSpindle) for updates and new source!
This library will only maintained to fix several issues!

###Environment
It supports scripting in Lua and includes the NyuFX library and the Yutils library for creating karaoke effects.

The Lua environment is extended by many functions and variables to make FXSpindle easier to use and more powerful than simple text manipulation.
Pre-calculated values and graphic+media functions allow advanced effects without much effort.

It's recommend to learn ASS as well as Lua before usage, but even without that it's possible to use it since the Lua scripting language and ASS are really easy to understand and learn.
